  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>Hello Everyone, welcome to my blog, today I am going to write about the items that I will be
    trashing but before
    trashing these items I want to understand how these items have helped me in my life and how I have
    used them. So
    I decided to track these items and understand how they have helped me get through the week. I will be doing this project based 
    the idea of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ontography">ontograpy</a> based on <a href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/exploded_ontography/">Bogost's</a> idea. 

    <br>

    Since my project is based on ontography, there are many parallels between my project and the concept of ontography. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bogost">Ian Bogost's</a> work on ontography involves accounting all sorts of issues and problems in the world but my website aims to map out and comprehend the entities that make up only my personal waste output. <br>

    <h4>Differences:</h4>
    My website may provide insight into my individual environmental impact, but it cannot address the larger systemic issues that contribute to environmental harm. Ontography aims to account for all units and includes all factors that reveal the underlying complexity of the world. However my website focuses on my personal waste output, which may seem inadequate in the face of more significant systemic problems. <br> <br>

    Another difference is that my website is practical and action-oriented approach to adress the systemic issues of trash and environmental footprint, but ontography is a theoretical and philosophical practice. My website aims to assist me in taking definitive steps towards reducing my environmental footprint, but ontography is much more generic and broader and instead focuses on the underlying complexity of the world. <br> 

    <h4>Similarites:</h4>
     Despite the differences, there are significant similarities between my website and ontography. Both ontogrophy and my website mapp out the issues. My website focuses on my personal waste output, but ontography might explores the world's issues. And at the end of the day the over achieving goal is to understand the world and the issues that are present in the world which both my website and ontogrophy  <br> <br>

    Moreover, the similarities and differences between my website and ontography prompt essential questions about the role of personal action in addressing environmental issues. While my website concentrates on individual behaviors, which may seem inadequate in the face of more significant systemic problems, ontography underscores the significance of accounting for all units, including those that may be invisible or overlooked. These different approaches encourage us to consider how personal action can be integrated into more extensive systemic changes and how we can account for the various units that contribute to environmental harm. <br>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
In conclusion, there are both differences similarites between the idea of ontography and my website, but the similarities show that this project is still very similar in somewhat achieving what ontography sets out to achieve. But to make my project better I would need to take a more philosophical approach and also try to sole the overlying issues rathern than just focus on the basic singular issue. <br> <br>

  <h3>Outfits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasses">glasses</a>: They were a great use to me but after getting checked again they are not enough I
      need more
      power in my classes hence I got new contact lenses as well new glasses hence I am going to
      throw/recycle/donate them.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacket">Jacket</a>: These are old jacket that I got them when I was in freshman year high school, they are
      too small and
      too tight so I also decided to donate them.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoes">Shoes</a>: I got these pairs for christmas on high school in 10th grade they were a great use but
      they are now
      too tight and I can’t wear them so I decided to throw them as well.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Electronics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series">ti84 calculator</a>: I got this in 8th grade for my advanced math course, however ever since its
      been a great
      use, but last semester in one of physics exam it suddenly stopped working. Hence I had to stop
      using it and
      I think its time to part ways with this calculator that has been a part of me for more than 6
      years.</li>
    <li> An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch">apple watch</a>: This watch was actually sent to a different country but it fell into a road
      and a car
      actually stopped working after that even though it looks like there is no scratch. After taking
      it to apple
      store for fixing they said its more beneficial to buy a new watch rather than paying for the
      repair, so its
      time to dispose this watch as well.</li>
    <li> A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator"> scientific calculator </a>: After the ti84 calculator stopped working I decided to resort
      to my backup
      calculator for the physics exam and sadly even this one stopped working hence I have to throw
      this as well
      now. And I had to take the exam without a calculator as well.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Travel Accessories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_accessories">An iphone Case</a>: this was useful to me when I traveled around and it helped me protect my phone
      but I changed
      my phone from iphone to android so this is of no use to me right now so I thought of disposing
      it.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_literature">Traveling notebook</a>: While traveling I also used a notebook as a logging device and I used it for many different
      travel as well
      as other things, such as school notes, but now that book is full and there aren’t any thing
      important
      written inside it so I its better off for me to throw it away.</li>
    <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_sanitizer">Hand sanitizer</a>: The third is the sanitizer, after the pandemic especially sanitizer and while traveling this
      came in very
      handy because it allowed me to travel

  <p>This was a great reflection as I learned to value all these things even more. I would try to
    reduce the waste as much as possible because I can reflect that everything that you own has some sort of importance to
    you so throwing them away feels a bit emotional. In addition I also learned that I can reduce my trash footprint by rather recycling and donating items rather than theowing them. 
    I encourage everyone to do the same and reccle as much as possible as this was a great experience for me. 
    I will try to test myself if I learned a good lesson by tracking my trash items again and see how much it helps and how much I have changed by doing this.
    Anyways this is the end of this weeks blog see you guys next time.
