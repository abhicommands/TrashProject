  <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>Hello Everyone, welcome to my blog, today I am going to write about the items that I will be trashing but before
    trashing these items I want to understand how these items have helped me in my life and how I have used them. So
    I decided to track these items and understand how they have helped me get through the week.</p>
  <h3>Outfits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Old Glasses: They were a great use to me but after getting checked again they are not enough I need more
      power in my classes hence I got new contact lenses as well new glasses hence I am going to
      throw/recycle/donate them.</li>
    <li>Jacket: These are old jacket that I got them when I was in freshman year high school, they are too small and
      too tight so I also decided to donate them.</li>
    <li>Shoes: I got these pairs for christmas on high school in 10th grade they were a great use but they are now
      too tight and I can’t wear them so I decided to throw them as well.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Electronics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A ti84 calculator, I got this in 8th grade for my advanced math course, however ever since its been a great
      use, but last semester in one of physics exam it suddenly stopped working. Hence I had to stop using it and
      I think its time to part ways with this calculator that has been a part of me for more than 6 years.</li>
    <li>An apple watch, this watch was actually sent to a different country but it fell into a road and a car
      actually stopped working after that even though it looks like there is no scratch. After taking it to apple
      store for fixing they said its more beneficial to buy a new watch rather than paying for the repair, so its
      time to dispose this watch as well.</li>
    <li>A regular scientific calculator, after the ti84 calculator stopped working I decided to resort to my backup
      calculator for the physics exam and sadly even this one stopped working hence I have to throw this as well
      now. And I had to take the exam without a calculator as well.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Travel Accessories</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>An iphone case, this was useful to me when I traveled around and it helped me protect my phone but I changed
      my phone from iphone to android so this is of no use to me right now so I thought of disposing it.</li>
    <li>While traveling I also used a notebook as a logging device and I used it for many different travel as well
      as other things, such as school notes, but now that book is full and there aren’t any thing important
      written inside it so I its better off for me to throw it away.</li>
    <li>The third is the sanitizer, after the pandemic especially sanitizer and while traveling this came in very
      handy because it allowed me to travel

  <p>This was a great reflection as I learned to value all these things even more. I would try to reduce the waste as
    much as possible because I can reflect that everything that you own has some sort of importance to you so
    throwing them away feels a bit emotional. Anyways this is the end of this weeks blog see you guys next time.</p>
